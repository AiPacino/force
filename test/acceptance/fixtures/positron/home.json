For much of history, muscles have been seen as vulgar, meaty indicators of labor; rather than strength they have suggested oafishness or, at best, potentially deviant self-regard. </p><p>Even today, we’re not clear on whether muscle is an indication of health or narcissism, menace or manliness.

In an unexpected turn, a Brooklyn judge ruled against the developers, who had made a final request to dismiss the case before trial. </p><p>The judge’s ruling breathes new life into the three-and-a-half-year-long lawsuit, originally stymied by earlier decisions which allowed the property owners to destroy the graffiti and redevelop the site. Today, luxury rentals now reside on the Queens lot where the warehouse once sat. </p><p>In their pending suit, the graffiti artists argue that the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA)—which grants visual artists limited rights over work they created but do not own—entitles them to monetary damages for the destruction of their art. </p><p>The developers, meanwhile, asserted that such rights are narrow and inapplicable given that, while the artists are well-known, the works are not. As such, they aren’t covered by VARA. But in his ruling Friday, judge Frederic Block sided with the artists, stating that the evidence provided by both sides was sufficient to merit putting their VARA claims in front of a jury. </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>Demolishing 5 Pointz</h2><p><br></p><p>The “aerosol” artists—as the court refers to them—are led by Jonathan Cohen, the most recent curator of the former graffiti mecca 5 Pointz. In the 1990s, while the building was mainly comprised of artist studios, the owner was asked to allow graffiti artists to work on the walls of the building. He agreed, and over time, the warehouse evolved into a living exhibition for local and international graffiti artists and fans alike. In the early 2000s, when Cohen assumed curative control, the building came to be known as 5 Pointz, named after the five boroughs of New York City. </p><p>Trouble began in 2013, when, after decades of this mutually beneficial arrangement, the owners voiced their intention to raze the warehouse and build a new housing development which would offer luxury rentals and a small selection of affordable units. The same year, Cohen and the others sued to prevent the destruction of their works which, at that time, still adorned the walls of the warehouse. </p><p>After initially delaying the development, the judge eventually denied the artists’ requests for permanent action in November 2013—though he left the door open for the artists to pursue monetary damages. The developers proceeded to whitewash the building overnight, allowing it to sit for months <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/nyregion/5pointz-a-graffiti-mecca-in-queens-is-wiped-clean-overnight.html\">before</a> it was eventually razed. This quick, perhaps unnecessary, washing of the graffiti served as a gut-punch to the artists who had pursued legal action to save the walls they saw as an extension of themselves. </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>VARA and Its Limits</h2><p><br></p><p>The 5 Pointz artists’s case against the developers stems from the Visual Artists Rights Act—or VARA for short. Passed in 1990, the law provides what are known as moral rights to artists behind qualifying works of visual art. Namely, it grants the rights to attribution and integrity. The right to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A\">integrity</a>, as invoked in the 5 Pointz lawsuit, provides artists with the ability to “to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature” even if that work exists on property owned by someone else—in this case, the building’s developers.</p><p>But VARA provides narrow protection with limited application compared to European laws dealing with similar issues. VARA’s right to integrity is limited in applicability to original copies of qualified works of <em>visual</em> art (thereby excluding music and other non-visual art). Additionally, the rights last only for the life of the artist, and may also be waived by the artist.</p><p>A significant limitation of VARA, and one which lies at the core of this case, is that a work must be of a “recognized stature” in order to prevent its destruction under the statute. Additionally, though the text of the statute states the ability to “prevent destruction,” courts are often limited in their abilities to actually follow through with this remedy, since they are required to weigh competing interests, including that of the property owner.</p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>VARA and 5 Pointz</h2><p><br></p><p>In refusing to prohibit the destruction of the artwork of 5 Pointz in 2013, the judge employed a narrow reading of VARA. That is, he ruled the statute provides monetary recourse for the destruction of visual works of “recognized stature,” but not the ability to indefinitely preserve the works. Since moving the art in this case was not an option, the only way to preserve it would have been to preserve the entire building, perhaps as a tourist attraction or cultural landmark. Judge Block noted that such remedies were wholly outside of those that the court had authority to grant under the statute. </p><p>Instead, he considered that the a monetary reward would make the artists whole. While this hollow reading of the statute was disappointing, it allowed for artists to seek monetary damages remains after destruction—which they did. Though developers had sought to prevent even an economic reward, Judge Block’s ruling Friday allows the artists claim to monetary damages under VARA to proceed. </p><p>One of the earliest cases to consider this issue and provide an important precedent coincidentally also took place in Queens. In <em>Carter v. Helmsley Spear, Inc.</em>, a developer removed a sculpture in a building he was renovating. The artist sued, relying on VARA for monetary damages. The court held that whether a work was of “recognized stature” under VARA must consider <em>both</em> whether the art “was viewed as meritorious,” and also whether art critics, experts, and other members of the art community considered that the art was “recognized.” </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>The Case Ahead</h2><p><br></p><p>This will be a critical issue in the 5 Pointz case. As the lawsuit proceeds to trial, each side will present art experts to voice their opinion on whether or not the work is important and well recognized. It will be up to the jury, based on the facts presented, to decide. </p><p>There is little doubt that Cohen and the other artists will be able to make a strong showing. 5 Pointz, both in life and in death, has been an institution for graffiti artists, widely acclaimed and discussed in both the local and international press. And a Brooklyn jury is likely to be sympathetic to the artists amid the constant churn of gentrifying landscapes. </p><p>The legal battle and eventual destruction of 5 Pointz also significantly raised its profile, which could have a positive impact on the damages, as the “stature” of the works is now exceptionally well-documented.</p><p>One potentially derailing factor, though, is that the court is of the view that each particular work should be considered separately. The judge has asked the artists to present a “final list” of all the works, so he may determine whether the claims will be managed by a single jury or multiple juries. &nbsp;</p><p>As moral rights in this country have evolved over the years, in some ways they have diverged from their original purpose. The emphasis on allowing artists to pursue monetary damages rather than a more holistic approach which protects the art for the public demonstrates the economic lens through which the United States views artists’ rights. Such a focus flies directly in the face of the purpose of moral rights. Still, one can understand the judicial need to assign financial value and rely on concrete evidence in these types of cases.</p><p>Regardless of how the 5 Pointz lawsuit plays out, it reflects a gaping hole in legislative protection of artists’ rights. In particular, putting a fixed economic value on a work’s destruction limits its value to the financial, failing to consider the work’s ineffable cultural contribution to the public writ large.</p><p><br></p><p>—Jessica Meiselman</p>"}],"id":"58e4c2dc7b181600179d7e6d","scheduled_publish_at":null,"thumbnail_image":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/EufE-wrWgsWX7t-3xVAHLw%2Fd7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront-42.jpg","published_at":"2017-04-05T21:27:14.168Z","slug":"artsy-editorial-5-pointz-graffiti-artists-score-major-win-suit-developers"},{"_id":"58e550d61f12da00171bfc9d","keywords":["AS","market","market analysis","Anna Louie Sussman"],"author_id":"542b5e477261693a3d3d0200","author":{"name":"Artsy Editorial","id":"542b5e477261693a3d3d0200"},"tier":1,"thumbnail_title":"Keynes’s Art Collection Shows Why Art Investing Is Like the Lottery","tags":["AS","market","market analysis"],"title":"Keynes’s Art Collection Shows Why Art Investing Is Like the Lottery","hero_section":null,"sections":[{"type":"image_collection","layout":"column_width","images":[{"url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/lFexE2F-lD7eAJf5ce0AjA%2FDeclan_in_20_years_2.jpg","type":"image","width":535,"height":315,"caption":"<p>John Maynard Keynes.

His work—not just theoretical but practical, in the many roles he assumed on behalf of the British government—laid the foundation for modern macroeconomics. His ideas still influence policymakers today, especially those calling for government spending, or stimulus, in times of low economic growth.</p><p>But that was just one facet of this mustachioed polymath who often spent his mornings working in bed, propped up by pillows and surrounded by books and papers, and nights dashing about London with its famed Bloomsbury Group, a group of artists, writers and thinkers <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-the-8-most-influential-artist-and-writer-duos-from-picasso-and-stein-to-rilke-and-rodin\">that included the likes of Virginia Woolf</a> and E.M. Forster. Keynes was an art lover and supporter, a friend of artists, and a canny art collector, whose collection of 135 works was bequeathed to Cambridge University’s King’s College. </p><p>It’s that slice of his extraordinary life that economists David Chambers, Elroy Dimson, and Christophe Spaenjers studied for their forthcoming paper, “Art Portfolios,” to better understand the long-run performance of art as an asset class. Keynes’s “portfolio,” or art collection, was amassed for less than £13,000. By 2013, it was valued at over £70 million, for an annualized real rate of return of 4.2% over the past half-century—virtually matching the performance of the total return on equities over the same period. So what does their analysis tell us about the art market?</p><p>By analyzing the performance of Keynes’s collection, and comparing it with the simulated performance of thousands of hypothetical art portfolios, they found that the art market was structured much like a lottery, with relatively few winners (artists and their collectors) reaping enormous gains, and the bulk of artists marginal to the overall value of the market. This will be entirely unsurprising to anyone who has stood on an Christie’s or Sotheby’s saleroom floor or perused the aisles of major art fairs like Art Basel or Frieze.</p><p>The art market has also largely eluded various attempts to estimate, measure, and index it. Historically, around half of transactions happen in the private market (in recent years that figure has crept higher), but publicly available auction records only include prices for works that successfully find a buyer. This can skew estimates of returns in auction-based indexes, although the exact nature of this bias is still being studied. In addition, consignors tend to sell works at auction when they expect a high return, meaning that auction-based indexes may overestimate returns due to this “selection bias.” </p><p>Keynes’s portfolio is somewhat unique in entirety avoiding these pitfalls, according to the authors. “It is one of only two complete, or near-complete, financial records of an art collection from initial purchase to final valuation,” they wrote, adding that it is the only one that also includes valuations at other intervening points in time. The other, the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, auctioned at Christie’s in 1997, was noted for its “extraordinary financial value,” while Keynes’s collection, by contrast, had no particular renown. It also came with extensive documentation of the purchases and why he made them. </p><p>“To our knowledge this was the only one where we could really observe purchase decisions by an art portfolio, then track the value of the collection’s items over time,” said Spaenjers, an associate finance professor at the business school HEC Paris. “You see all these decisions being played out over many decades.…You can see how his purchase decisions changed with his personal fortune.”</p><p>And while it was not sold off, the collection has been valued over the years by insurers, auction houses, and finally through independent appraisals ordered by the study’s authors in 2013. </p><p>“In creating indexes, they’re always hypothetical,” said William Goetzmann, a Yale University finance professor who has previously collaborated with Spaenjers. “Lots of us have spent time trying to do indexes, but we really don’t know whether those represent the true return to investing…this has the special virtue that it’s an actual portfolio.”</p><p>Their analysis and comparison with hypothetical portfolios revealed several features of Keynes’s collection with implications for the broader market. One is the importance of the purchase channel. Keynes’s “winning lottery tickets”—in art world terms, paintings and drawings by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/edgar-degas\">Degas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/paul-cezanne\">Cezanne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/georges-braque\">Braque</a>—were largely purchased at auction, where Spaenjers guessed he was able to spot bargains. (Incidentally, Keynes was also known to be an excellent stock picker.) The works he acquired through other channels, through dealers and on the primary market, underperformed relative to his auction purchases. Of course, Keynes wasn’t simply lucky; he had what today’s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513896351/black-edge-recounts-the-biggest-insider-trading-scandal-in-history\">hedge funders call “edge,”</a> insider tips shared through artist friends, including his one-time lover, the English painter <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/duncan-grant\">Duncan Grant</a>. Spaenjers said Keynes also appeared to time his purchases well, for example, buying works by <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/anthony-van-dyck\">van Dyck</a> at auction when prices were low, or buying in Paris after World War I when the market was likely depressed. </p><p>Another characteristic of Keynes’s portfolio is its high level of concentration, with 80% of his total art spend going to just 10 works. In 2013, the 10 most valuable works accounted for 91% of the portfolio’s total value. “Changes in the total value of the Keynes collection are largely driven by changes in the market value of a few artists, such as Braque, Cezanne, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse\">Matisse</a>, Picasso and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/georges-seurat\">Seurat</a>,” the authors concluded. “Conversely, what happens to all the lesser-known artists…is not an important driver of returns.” Keynes’s portfolio performance points to an enduring quality of the broader art market (and, increasingly, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707838-dearth-competition-among-firms-helps-explain-wage-inequality-and-host-other\">the economy at large</a>), that it’s a “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803469?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">superstar economy</a>,” in which works by a few highly sought-after artists reap outsized returns. For example, the 20 best performing artists at auction have changed little over the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-art-basel-report-suggests-growing-inequality-endangering-art-market\">topped by perennial names</a> like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/bruce-nauman\">Bruce Nauman</a>, and Pablo Picasso, according to The Art Market | 2017, a recently released <a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/about/initiatives/the-art-market\">report</a> from Art Basel and UBS. </p><p>Savvy art investors, at this point, likely know that executing a “buy low, sell high” strategy is easier said than done, given that so few young artists go on to command serious prices at auction. But even a portfolio diversification strategy (the idea behind mutual funds that hold a wide array of equities) is hard to implement when it comes to art, as this study highlights. When so much of the value of Keynes’s portfolio lay in a handful of key works, and buying them required significant upfront investment, successful arts investment appears to be a game for the already well-capitalized. </p><p>Still, the opacity of the art market does leave potential for well-positioned and deeply informed insiders to take advantage of information asymmetries, such as knowing when a work might become available or where a willing buyer lies. And in the study’s simulated portfolios, constructed at random from a global database of auction transactions, roughly a third of even small portfolios outperformed the equity market, a function the wide range of performance (most of them significantly underperformed). The key variable, of course, was the presence or absence of one of the “lottery ticket” artists in the hypothetical portfolio. </p><p>“There’s such wide variation that you can’t really conclude [Keynes] was ‘skilled,’” said Spaenjers. “But what you do see from reading about his life and his decisions is that he was given advice by his artist friends. It’s the type of edge that probably still could today play a role, especially in the contemporary market.”</p><p><br></p><p>—Anna Louie Sussman</p>"}],"primary_featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artwork_ids":null,"partner_ids":null,"show_ids":null,"fair_ids":[],"fair_programming_ids":[],"fair_artsy_ids":[],"fair_about_ids":[],"auction_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"biography_for_artist_id":null,"featured":true,"exclude_google_news":false,"contributing_authors":[{"id":"5882874db202a36465000667","name":"Anna Louie Sussman"}],"email_metadata":{"headline":"Keynes’s Art Collection Shows Why Art Investing Is Like the Lottery","author":"Anna Louie Sussman","credit_line":"","credit_url":"","image_url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/A8O5S78Os8bwB3dotyKMzw%2FDeclan_in_20_years_2.jpg","custom_text":""},"is_super_article":false,"super_article":{"partner_link":"","partner_logo":"","partner_link_title":"","partner_logo_link":"","partner_fullscreen_header_logo":"","secondary_partner_logo":"","secondary_logo_text":"","secondary_logo_link":"","footer_blurb":"","related_articles":[]},"send_body":false,"channel_id":"5759e3efb5989e6f98f77993","partner_channel_id":null,"description":"The famed economist Keynes was an art lover and supporter, and his collection gives a surprising level of insight into the long-run performance of art as an asset class.","social_title":"","social_description":"","search_title":"","search_description":"","seo_keyword":"","layout":"center","published":true,"daily_email":true,"weekly_email":false,"updated_at":"2017-04-05T21:29:23.468Z","lead_paragraph":"","id":"58e550d61f12da00171bfc9d","scheduled_publish_at":null,"thumbnail_image":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/A8O5S78Os8bwB3dotyKMzw%2FDeclan_in_20_years_2.jpg","published_at":"2017-04-05T20:25:33.298Z","slug":"artsy-editorial-keyness-art-collection-art-investing-lottery"},{"_id":"58e3443c48dd6d0027c81797","keywords":["art","art world","TT","Anselm Kiefer","Charlotte Jansen"],"author_id":"4fa02a2940a1a500010003f3","author":{"name":"Artsy Editorial","id":"4fa02a2940a1a500010003f3"},"tier":1,"thumbnail_title":"Anselm Kiefer on the Existential Crisis Facing Humanity","tags":["art","art world","TT"],"title":"Anselm Kiefer on the Existential Crisis Facing Humanity","hero_section":null,"primary_featured_artist_ids":["4d8b92ba4eb68a1b2c000448"],"featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artwork_ids":null,"partner_ids":null,"show_ids":null,"fair_ids":[],"fair_programming_ids":[],"fair_artsy_ids":[],"fair_about_ids":[],"auction_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"biography_for_artist_id":null,"featured":true,"exclude_google_news":false,"contributing_authors":[{"id":"56f97032275b247bf8003195","name":"Charlotte Jansen"}],"email_metadata":{"headline":"Anselm Kiefer on the Existential Crisis Facing Humanity","author":"Charlotte Jansen","credit_line":"","credit_url":"","image_url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/rPxO1asITKRODqseYTJhRQ%2Fak.jpg","custom_text":""},"is_super_article":false,"super_article":{"partner_link":"","partner_logo":"","partner_link_title":"","partner_logo_link":"","partner_fullscreen_header_logo":"","secondary_partner_logo":"","secondary_logo_text":"","secondary_logo_link":"","footer_blurb":"","related_articles":[]},"send_body":false,"channel_id":"5759e3efb5989e6f98f77993","partner_channel_id":null,"description":"As the world-renowned German artist opens a new exhibition of replica World War II-era bomber planes, he reflects on today’s turbulent political landscape.

She introduced him to the work of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/lucian-freud\">Lucian Freud</a>, who was at that time the subject of a retrospective at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/themodernfw\">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>.</p><p>Bush’s competitive nature and confidence worked in his favor. “He was quick, he had a good memory,” Norfleet says. “Oil paint moves; you can put it down and then take it away, and he was not afraid to make marks that were wrong.”</p><p>At the time, Norfleet herself was creating figurative work, painting her students in the classroom, as well as people looking at art. “A figurative thing was going on in my head at the time; I was looking at so many different people, which made it fitting when we started the world figures series,” she explains.</p><p>Under Norfleet’s tutelage, Bush completed a series of more than 24 world leaders, from his father, George H.W. Bush, to the Dalai Lama. These works went on display at his presidential library in 2014.

He set up a meeting with the Giannoni family—marble artisans with a long history of replicating iconic Vatican sculptures. Gray, who was interested in slowing down production of his work, was drawn to their adherence to centuries-old, manual methods—rather than the mechanical processes now in use by many studios in the area. </p><p>At first, the Giannonis were hesitant about the idea of making contemporary work. The studio frequently turns down commissions; even today, they partner with just one other contemporary artist, the Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/giuseppe-penone\">Giuseppe Penone</a>. But then Marco Giannoni, a fourth-generation artisan and current head of the studio, saw a resin cast of Gray’s work <em>Ghost Girl </em>(2007). Though it’s fashioned in a traditional style, the sculpture of a young girl, with her head bent and hands clasped behind her back, has flashes of modernity—slashed wrists and a long, beaded curtain of Swarovski crystals concealing her face. “Kevin already had such interesting ideas, even back then,” Giannoni <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tuscan-marble-studio-honors-bygone-traditions-1490281994\">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. </p><p>Gray’s most recent body of work, on view now at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/pace-gallery\">Pace Gallery</a>, ventures even further from traditional sculpture. Although he’s concealed the identity of his subjects in much of his previous work—often through veils or draped cloth—in these works he does so in a markedly different manner. He’s created several busts and full-body nudes and then gouged and reshaped them with probing fingers—a vivid reminder of the sculptor’s hand at work. </p>"},{"type":"image_collection","layout":"overflow_fillwidth","images":[{"url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wIIgdyTGdbkIeYiLeeU_Pg%2FIMG_3731.jpg","type":"image","width":900,"height":1200,"caption":"<p>Work by Kevin Francis Gray in the studio.

Gray’s studio manager Anakena Paddon says they want to enhance that feeling with their decision to allow visitors to touch the works in the gallery. “It’s so enticing,” she says. “You want to put your hands where the artist’s hand has been. When you feel how hard the rock is, you also realize the amount of manual labor that’s gone into the production. It’s a really moving experience.” </p><p>The production of each sculpture is no small feat. First, Gray crafts a clay model in his London studio, which is then cast in plaster and sent to the marble workshop in Pietrasanta. There, it is translated from plaster to stone by a team of trained artisans. The block itself can take some two to three weeks to select; Gray relies on Giannoni’s intuition and experience to sense if there may be a hidden flaw in the stone. Then it takes months—six to nine for a bust, or up to a year for a full-length nude—to realize the final sculptures. </p><p>Although any work to come out of the studio will follow this process, the sculptures for the Pace show were particularly time-intensive. Before they began work on these sculptures, there were just three artisans staffing the studio. As the work progressed, the team swelled to eight; the 76-year-old Piero Quadrelli, a master at carving a rough form into the block of marble, even came out of retirement to pitch in. The work was unlike anything they’d done before, even the contemporary pieces they had crafted for Gray’s previous shows—many of which were based on Neoclassical sculpture. In total, seven works on view at Pace took three years to complete.</p>"},{"type":"image_collection","layout":"overflow_fillwidth","images":[{"url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/rBkhXEjUM_0a1G7WEjNmzA%2FCave+Girl+medium+9+closed+lev.jpg","type":"image","width":800,"height":1200,"caption":"<p>Kevin Francis Gray, <em>Cave Girl</em>, 2016.

Hirst, in fact, never visited the studio that produced his £1 million <em>Anatomy of an Angel </em>(2008) (he approved the work through photographs). But Gray visits Italy often, spending some 10 days each month in the studio. Not only is he there to supervise, but he actually handles the fine detailing of the sculptures himself.</p><p>It’s not easy work, he notes. Carving kicks up so much white marble dust that the artisans are jokingly referred to as the “ghosts of Pietrasanta.” Gray’s favorite part of the process is the end. “It’s so labor-intensive and so emotionally and physically attritional, it’s such a joy to walk away from a piece.”</p><p>Michelangelo’s presence in the town has been well documented; bronze plaques mark houses where, centuries ago, he may have slept, while a local cafe claims the distinction of serving as his workspace during a visit in 1518. But the connection is even more explicit in Gray’s Pace show. One piece, titled <em>Cave Girl </em>(2016), was carved from a block of marble extracted from the very same cave Michelangelo sourced for his marble back in the 1500s. </p><p>“They’re using the same techniques that <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/antonio-canova\">Canova</a> did, that Michelangelo’s studio did,” Paddon says of the Giannoni workshop. “It’s a way of work and life that is facing extinction because it’s obviously intensely laborious.

So Gilbert Baker, a 27-year-old artist and drag queen, began brainstorming. He felt his people needed an icon that would simultaneously communicate beauty, diversity, and power. It also had to be easily replicable. Then it hit him.</p><p>Armed with sewing skills he had honed while assembling costumes for his lady alter ego “Busty Ross,” Baker pieced together the world’s first rainbow flag. It had eight brilliantly saturated stripes—pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for peace, and purple for spirit—that could be flown proudly in the air.</p><p>Before long, it would become the most prominent symbol of the international gay rights movement.</p><p>This past week, Baker died at the age of 65 at his home in New York City. And while his death was premature, he lived long enough to see the rainbow flag proliferate across the globe as a rallying cry for equal rights—and even enter into the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a>’s permanent collection, where it’s been lauded as a crowning example of effective social design.</p><p>At the urging of Paola Antonelli, MoMA’s senior curator of architecture and design, and Michelle Fisher, the department’s curatorial assistant, the museum purchased one of Baker’s flags in 2015. To some, the acquisition was an anomaly for a major museum, where <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a> paintings valued at seven-figure sums also reside. Versions of Baker’s flag, on the other hand, can be purchased for $75 and less in the MoMA shop and on FlagsImporter.com.</p><p>But Antonelli and Fisher believe the flag’s accessibility—and ubiquity, in some areas of the world—are precisely what make it an influential and historic cultural object. “Baker wanted everyone to have it and to benefit from it,” says Antonelli of the flag. “And from this generosity was born a design success,” continues Fisher. </p>"},{"type":"image_collection","layout":"overflow_fillwidth","images":[{"url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/Jtj3_m78daskJQZHhVwqVQ%2FGettyImages-165887513.jpg","type":"image","width":1200,"height":800,"caption":"<p>Gilbert Baker, creator of the rainbow flag attends the 27th Annual Night Of A Thousand Gowns at the Hilton New York on April 6, 2013 in New York City.

Instead of restricting its use, he wanted his community to brandish the flag freely, whether at protests or flapping behind cars, bikes, or out of apartment-building windows. </p><p>At the time, Harvey Milk—then a city supervisor for San Francisco and California’s first openly gay politician—was encouraging the gay community to come out, and Barker hoped the flag would amplify his friend’s call. “A flag really fit that mission, because that’s a way of proclaiming your visibility, or saying, ‘This is who I am!,’” said Baker in a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/06/17/moma-acquires-the-rainbow-flag/\">interview</a> with Fisher. </p><p>The flag’s bold color scheme and simple layout also served to spread the symbol and its message. Both were easily replicable, whether with strips of colored fabric or a simple marker or paint pack. And it became even simpler several years later, when Baker reduced the flag from eight to six colors. </p><p>In the 1970s and early ’80s, pink and turquoise fabrics were pricey, as was eight-color photo printing. Baker knew that the accurate representation of the flag in photographs was essential to its proliferation, and he wanted to ensure that it was easy and inexpensive to recreate. </p><p>And even with fewer colors, the flag’s impassioned message of diversity remained clear and strong.

Influenced by Paul Klee and “what he did with a line, a point or a stroke of the paintbrush,” Albers used weaving to develop a signature visual vocabulary of hard-edged patterns. Her early tapestries would go on to have a considerable impact on the development of geometric abstraction in the visual arts, along with the work of several of her Bauhaus peers, including her husband, Josef Albers, who she met at the school.</p><p>Albers explored the functional possibilities of textiles with focus and passion; in 1930, she designed a cotton and cellophane curtain that simultaneously absorbed sound and reflected light.

Levin encourages his clients to first pursue education before pursuing objects because, he said, they “tend to have more hits than misses” when they do buy.</p><p>To gain confidence in your ability to determine whether, for you, a work’s price and value are aligned, Levin suggests developing relationships with ten to fifteen young galleries—and make a point of visiting each of them once a month. “Much new art looks exciting in the context of the gallery opening or art fair,” he said. “It is quite common to feel underwhelmed by artworks one may have had initial enthusiasm about. Spending time with great art helps exercise and sharpen the eye to look at the new.”</p>"},{"type":"callout","thumbnail_url":null,"text":null,"article":"58a6368973d6ec0011c593f0","hide_image":false,"top_stories":false},{"type":"text","body":"<p>Even before embedding yourself in the art community, you can learn some basic guidelines that typically inform an artwork’s price. While there are no hard-and-fast rules, said Rebekah Bowling, specialist and head of the New Now 20th century and contemporary art auction at Phillips, unique objects (such as a painting or sculpture created by hand) tend to cost more than editioned works, such as, say, a series of ten prints, of which you might buy just one. Similarly, the work’s medium will often influence price. For the same artist, a work on paper will typically cost less than a painting of the same scale. Size is also a factor: bigger works tend to command bigger prices. </p><p>An artist’s life cycle is another key factor. Artists at the very beginning of their careers will typically have lower price points than mid-career artists, who typically have been showing their work for around a decade and have garnered some media attention and shown at a regional or national level. More established artists tend to cost more; they’ve typically been shown internationally and may be part of institutional collections. Similarly, younger galleries in frontier neighborhoods should have more entry-level works than ones with ground-floor spaces in <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-costs-gallery-new-york-city\">more established neighborhoods</a> like New York’s Chelsea or London’s Mayfair. </p><p>Nicholas Campbell, founder and managing director of London-based Narcissus Arts, a consultancy specializing in works priced under £10,000, advises his clients to consider originality when they’re evaluating a work’s price. “Every now and then there is something that jumps out,” he said, and that’s the quality that will likely contribute to an artist’s longevity and value in the broader cultural landscape, which in turn tends to increase price. </p>"},{"type":"callout","thumbnail_url":null,"text":null,"article":"58b6470fad083b001134d5d8","hide_image":false,"top_stories":false},{"type":"text","body":"<p>When artists do something truly original, they tend to get noticed by critics, curators, and fellow artists. That could range from bringing a fresh perspective to representation (<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/kerry-james-marshall\">Kerry James Marshall</a>’s large-scale portraits of black life, highlighted in last year’s retrospective at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/metmuseum\">The Met Breuer</a>, come to mind) to innovating with a new medium or technique (such as artists working with <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-virtual-reality-is-the-most-powerful-artistic-medium-of-our-time\">virtual reality</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-move-virtual-reality-new-artistic-medium-emerge\">mixed reality</a>.) Art advisers like Campbell and Levin use a background in art history to try to spot those artists before they’re widely known.</p><p>Campbell also looks at tangible data points within an artist’s CV to better understand where they have been and where they might be going. He’ll look at schools the artist has attended, any prizes she or he has won or been nominated for, whether the artist has had a solo show or been featured in group shows at prominent institutions, which curators follow his or her work, and whether the work has traveled nationally or internationally. “You can find 23-year-olds who have their BA, their MA, have been in three group shows or a national show, and have already gotten awards,” said Campbell. “That shows there’s a real trajectory.” </p><p>Of course, not every artist comes with an obvious pedigree. In that case, Campbell advises looking more closely at the work—the process, the artist’s intention, what ideas and techniques animate it. He mentioned an artist who’d recently had a London show who “quite literally knocks these [works] together in 40 minutes, and is now charging four grand,” but who couldn’t actually explain the work to him when Campbell visited his studio. Those works, Campbell felt safe in saying, do not justify their price tag. By contrast, he said, clients can intuit the value of work that’s deeply labor-intensive, intricate, and thoughtful. Another facet of his work is trying to introduce his clients to artists, “to give them a sense of what’s going through the artist’s head.” </p><p>That’s something Levin advises too, if at all possible, since artists are perhaps best positioned <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-how-young-artists-are-setting-prices-for-their-work\">to explain their pricing</a> and what makes one work more dear to them than another. Once you know an artist, he said, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask a question about, say, why two works of the same size are priced seven thousand dollars apart. “Put that question out in a way that you’re obviously not attacking them, but you’re genuinely curious about why” the price discrepancy exists, Levin advised. “People aren’t afraid to have those kinds of monetary conversations because they feel it’s genuinely couched in curiosity.”</p>"},{"type":"callout","thumbnail_url":null,"text":null,"article":"57f29edcadee490f00f4c3fa","hide_image":false,"top_stories":false},{"type":"text","body":"<p>Timing matters too. Bowling recommends checking an artist’s CV for consistent output and recognition. “Have they been working every year?” she asked. “Or has this person not done anything since 2012?” Levin suggests waiting and watching an artist mature for a few years before buying something, to see if the work continues to evolve. “It’s better to spend the $25,000 when you are a little more comfortable with the market variables than taking the chance at $10,000,” he said. </p><p>Another factor to consider is where the art gets sold. Galleries price works according to the size of the work, the success of the most recent show, and any other relevant career-related variables, such as a recent institutional show or a nomination for an award, said Bowling, who spent seven years at Andrea Rosen Gallery before joining Phillips. In addition, galleries try to keep the prices for their artists on a steady upward trajectory, rather than riding the highs and lows of the broader art market as auction prices more often do. By contrast, auction estimates usually account for buyers’ tastes and appetites, as well as where the art market is in its cycle. “I have to think about many people it will appeal to, how many bidders, how that competition is going to drive up the price, and base my estimate range on that,” she said.</p><p>While Bowling describes herself as “the biggest proponent of the gallery system,” she said the straightforward nature of auction pricing can be a great entry point for new collectors. “I think there’s something appealing about the auction environment,” she said. “Here’s the estimate range, we have an auction, and people bid against each other. That’s how the price is achieved.” </p><p>Bowling, Campbell, and Levin all stressed one thing: Collectors shouldn’t treat art like a financial investment. (That’s even, and perhaps especially, the case for those who work in financial services, who often cite headlines of multi-million-dollar prices achieved at auction.) Since most art works do not increase in value, Bowling suggests finding a risk threshold, and buying within those limits. For one collector, that might be $3,000, or, for another, $3 million. “Find that threshold you’re comfortable with losing or gambling on,” she advised, “and if you go beyond that level, do more research.”</p><p>Levin goes further. He recommends assuming the price for a work by a new artist will go to zero after, say, five years, much as a dining set would lose most of its value over a similar time frame. If that work cost $5,000, or $1,000 a year, it works out to a cost of roughly $3 a day. “Is the piece going to give you $3 of pleasure a day?” he asks. If it does, “then it’s worth what you paid for it.” And that, he said, is the point of buying art.</p><p>“If you want to buy stocks,” Levin said, “you can just hang bags of money on the wall.” </p><p>—Anna Louie Sussman</p>"}],"primary_featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artwork_ids":null,"partner_ids":null,"show_ids":null,"fair_ids":[],"fair_programming_ids":[],"fair_artsy_ids":[],"fair_about_ids":[],"auction_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"biography_for_artist_id":null,"featured":true,"exclude_google_news":false,"contributing_authors":[{"id":"5890cbe8b202a303d9400ca1","name":"Anna Louie Sussman"}],"email_metadata":{"headline":"How Artworks Get Their Price","author":"Anna Louie Sussman","credit_line":"","credit_url":"","image_url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/qtg90DmDHq9p6b3Y9mDr3w%2FNew+Collector_2+copy+2.jpg","custom_text":""},"is_super_article":false,"super_article":{"partner_link":"","partner_logo":"","partner_link_title":"","partner_logo_link":"","partner_fullscreen_header_logo":"","secondary_partner_logo":"","secondary_logo_text":"","secondary_logo_link":"","footer_blurb":"","related_articles":[]},"send_body":false,"channel_id":"5759e3efb5989e6f98f77993","partner_channel_id":null,"description":"How does an artwork get its price?

The images did not show people at the ballot box because, even as citizens, those posting videos did not have the right to vote.

But it raises questions about what role artists will play in Hong Kong going forward, and how the city’s cultural institutions might be impacted by Lam’s administration.</p><p>Lam’s election comes at an important moment for the Hong Kong cultural community.

During her tenure, major controversy erupted following the surprise announcement last December that a version of Beijing’s <a href=\"http://www.ejinsight.com/20170126-palace-museum-tells-us-how-carrie-lam-will-govern/\">Palace Museum</a> would be created in Hong Kong, erected in the city’s 40-hectare cultural hub.</p><p>Expected to showcase artifacts from the collection of the Beijing institution, the privately-funded, HK$ 3.5 billion Hong Kong Palace Museum appeared to many as the product of secretive dealings with Beijing—done without prior public or legislative consultation. Former West Kowloon CEO <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2057951/hong-kong-no-2-carrie-lam-unveils-honour-list-tycoons\">Michael Lynch</a> charged the Hong Kong Palace Museum was out of step with the district’s overall blueprint, and questioned if it served a political, rather than a cultural, purpose. Lam has defended the plan, arguing that it doesn’t require public approval given it is privately funded and that any opposition would prove “embarrassing.”</p><p>Still, the shadow cast by the museum has many suspicious. “How Lam executed the Palace Museum plan shows how she functions,” said <a href=\"http://www.kaceywong.com/list-of-works-protest/\">Kacey Wong</a>, an artist and activist who participated in the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement. Hong Kong retains its own legal system and freedom of expression is guaranteed under the Basic Law, the city’s “mini constitution.” But Beijing’s increasing influence over Hong Kong affairs is apparent. </p><p>“As a civil servant of more than 30 years, [Lam] knows the system inside out, and she can find the loophole to get around the system in order to carry out Beijing’s order,” Wong added, saying he worries about the possibility of self-censorship by artists and curators as they shy away from politically sensitive subjects. </p><p>“Museums and institutions are in difficult positions,” he said. “It’s not just about [showing art that is] aggressive or progressive. Historical topics, such as the colonial history of Hong Kong, aren’t encouraged.”</p><p>Just before the election took place, reports emerged that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2081275/hong-kongs-graft-buster-investigate-carrie-lam-over-museum\">Hong Kong graft-buster’s investigation</a> was looking into Lam’s role in the Hong Kong Palace Museum plan over what one city lawmaker described as the “inappropriate transferral of benefits.” But in keeping with its policy, the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption could not confirm individual investigations. </p><p>Other institutions offer potential bright spots. The recent exhibition <a href=\"http://asiasociety.org/hong-kong/exhibitions/breathing-space-contemporary-art-hong-kong\">Breathing Space: Contemporary Art from Hong Kong</a> at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/asia-society-hk\">Asia Society Hong Kong Center</a>, for example, contained artworks that carry socio-political undertones. One example was <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/south-ho-siu-nam\">South Ho Siu Nam</a>’s work <em>Defense and Resistance </em>(2013), which shows the artist building a wall around himself with bricks marked “MADE IN XIANGGANG.” The phrase highlights the contradictions in Hong Kong following its handover to Beijing: Xianggang is the Mandarin pronunciation of Hong Kong, which itself is a Cantonese-speaking city.</p><p>Artists also said they have high hopes for the HK$ 5 billion (US$ 640 million) M+ visual culture museum, slated for a 2019 opening in the West Kowloon Cultural District, next door to the Hong Kong Palace Museum. Even as some fear censorship, Suhanya Raffel, the executive director of M+, assured the artistic freedom of this mega museum. </p><p>“M+ is an important and necessary global museum, bringing to the forefront visual culture of the 20th and 21st centuries with a strong Asian perspective,” she said in an email. “M+ has been structured to ensure curatorial independence with a governance structure that includes its own M+ Board and Acquisition Committee and will continue to function as an independent voice in the community.”</p><p>Outside of museums, the streets have become an active space for the city’s creative minds, particularly since the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1610547/occupys-umbrella-statue-symbol-peace-says-artist\">Umbrella Movement</a> in 2014. Beyond just artists, such expression offers a way for young people generally to vent their frustrations with the political situation. And protest and activist art—like Add Oil Team’s Facebook Live videos—are seen by some as more viable when occurring in the public sphere, away from the art world establishment.</p><p>“Many artists are now making works and leading projects in the community, whether in local districts or villages, or doing conservation projects,” said Add Oil Team member Sampson Wong. “It’s not just about making an impact on a general public, but also bringing creative satisfaction to artists, connecting them with what’s happening in the society.”</p><p>Sampson Wong said despite the public’s frustration over Tsang’s loss in the election, his <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2081904/thousands-show-support-john-tsang-campaign-rally\">campaign</a>—which earned him unprecedented support for any politician in Hong Kong—could serve as an inspiration for artists. The artist said the reverse was true, with Tsang’s campaign borrowing ideas of hope and unification from socially engaged art. </p><p>Following the results, the question confronting all of Hong Kong is: What comes next? “As a civil society, how can we move forward?” Wong asks. It’s a question he is sure art will play an important role in answering.</p><p>—Vivienne Chow </p>"}],"primary_featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artist_ids":null,"featured_artwork_ids":null,"partner_ids":null,"show_ids":null,"fair_ids":[],"fair_programming_ids":[],"fair_artsy_ids":[],"fair_about_ids":[],"auction_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"biography_for_artist_id":null,"featured":true,"exclude_google_news":false,"contributing_authors":[{"id":"56f0b8549c18db2da4000740","name":"Vivienne Chow"}],"email_metadata":{"headline":"Hong Kong’s New Chief Executive Could Reshape the City’s Arts Scene","author":"Vivienne Chow","credit_line":"","credit_url":"","image_url":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/njri5LLn7gg9Im0P3TylLg%2FGettyImages-658631024.jpg","custom_text":""},"is_super_article":false,"super_article":{"partner_link":"","partner_logo":"","partner_link_title":"","partner_logo_link":"","partner_fullscreen_header_logo":"","secondary_partner_logo":"","secondary_logo_text":"","secondary_logo_link":"","footer_blurb":"","related_articles":[]},"send_body":false,"channel_id":"5759e3efb5989e6f98f77993","partner_channel_id":null,"description":"With the election of Carrie Lam as Hong Kong’s next chief executive, artists see Beijing’s growing control of the city and its culture.","social_title":"Artists Remain Defiant as Beijing Tightens Grip on Hong Kong","social_description":"","search_title":"","search_description":"","seo_keyword":"","layout":"center","published":true,"daily_email":false,"weekly_email":false,"updated_at":"2017-04-03T22:39:12.557Z","lead_paragraph":"","id":"58e2822548dd6d0027c81795","scheduled_publish_at":null,"thumbnail_image":"https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/njri5LLn7gg9Im0P3TylLg%2FGettyImages-658631024.jpg","published_at":"2017-04-03T17:58:27.259Z","slug":"artsy-editorial-hong-kongs-new-chief-executive-reshape-citys-arts-scene"}]}
